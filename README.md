Link: https://n423-homework-five.web.app/ 

This week, our assignment was to create a Firebase project and utilize our Firestore database. We were create a collection called Albums, and add albums with 3 specific genres to it. The page should load all albums in the database, and have a way to get albums from a specific genre.
The main goals of this assignment were: 
- Understand how to retrieve, query, and add data
- Add documents to a collection in Firestore
- display all information of a collection when a site first loads
- Select all information based on a specific criteria.

Features:
- Album Name, Artist Name, Album Cover, and Album Genre inputs
- All albums with relevant information is displayed
- 3 buttons for the 3 different genres; displays respective albums based on genre picked

Although there are 15 albums already stored in the database, feel free to add more! Simply input the needed information, store the album in the database, and watch Firestore retrieve and display it immediately! Only want to see albums from one specific genre? No Problem! Simply click the genre you want to see, and all albums under it will display underneath.
